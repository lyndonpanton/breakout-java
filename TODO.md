## Game design

- [ ] Difficulty should increase once a stage has been cleared
  - More bricks, with the closest layer now closest to the player than the
  previous
  - Ball increases in speed
  - Ball shoots of bricks at a random angle, instead of the opposite angle it
  hit a particular brick 

## Game programming

- [x] A ball should be drawn on the screen
  - [x] The ball should start in the center of the x-axis and a certain height
  - [x] The ball should be released a random angle (within a range)
- [x] A paddle should be drawn on the screen
- [x] Player should be able to control the paddle movement
  - [x] Movement should be along the x-axis
- [ ] Ball should be able to collide with the paddle
  - [ ] Ball should change trajectory appropriately after a collision with the
  player paddle
- [ ] Ball should be able to collide with the vertical edges of the screen
  - [ ] Ball should change trajectory appropriately after a collision with a
  vertical edge
- [ ] Ball should be able to collide with the top edge of the screen
  - [ ] Ball should change trajectory appropriately after a collision with the
  top edge
- [ ] Ball should be able to collide with the top edge of the screen
  - [ ] Game restarts if the ball collides with the bottom edge
- [ ] Rows of bricks should be drawn on the screen
  - [ ] Ball should be able to collide with any brick
    - [ ] Bricks are destroyed when the ball collides with them
    - [ ] Ball should change trajectory appropriately after a collision with a
    brick
- [ ] Player should be able to pause the game

## Graphics

## Project management

- [ ] Create a collision matrix

## Sound

- [ ] Ball <-> paddle sound effect
- [ ] Ball <-> vertical edge sound effect
- [ ] Ball <-> top edge sound effect
- [ ] Ball <-> brick sound effect
  - A unique sound effect can be made for each type of brick
- [ ] Game pause sound effect
- [ ] Gameplay music
- [ ] Pause music

## User interface
